                    <h3>Web-Design</h3>
                    <p>I currently have 4 years of website design and development experience.
                        I own and operate a website development company named Newberry Software
                        that produces custom websites for any size business or client. I have worked
                        with several langugages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as many
                        different frameworks such as Django and Angular.

                    <h3>Corporate Management</h3>
                    <p>I have held the responsibility of leading, directing, and administrating two software
                        development companies (one of which I currently own). Corporate management,
                        in my understanding, is more talent than skill. Great management is instinctual.
                        I do not believe leadership can be properly taught. Corporate management requires
                        strategic plans and efficient use of resources. The ability to effectively communicate
                        with a diverse group of people and accomplish a common goal is the most
                        important attribute of every leader.

                    <h3>Serial Innovation</h3>
                    <p>My first major addition to a system was when I was in elementary school and
                        revolutionized a recycling program to significantly reduce waste in the
                        Belmont-Redwood Shores school district. Since then I have brought innovation
                        to many places including sports training facilities, little league umpiring organizations,
                        marketing companies, private investment groups, and my own business.

                    <h3>Client Prospecting</h3>
                    <p>My father is an expert in client prospecting and spent years teaching me ways to
                        find and approach new clients. Prospecting is nearly an art form that I have grown
                        to appreciate and respect. Great prospecting saves a business valuable time and brings
                        the best clients to the table.
