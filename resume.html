                                <p>I currently have 4 years of website design and development experience.<br>I own and operate a website development company named Newberry Software<br>that produces custom websites for any size business or client. I have worked<br>with several langugages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript as well as many<br>different frameworks such as Django and Angular.</p>

                                <p>I have held the responsibility of leading, directing, and administrating two software<br>development companies (one of which I currently own). Corporate management,<br>in my understanding, is more talent than skill. Great management is instinctual.<br>I do not believe leadership can be properly taught. Corporate management requires<br>strategic plans and efficient use of resources. The ability to effectively communicate<br>with a diverse group of people and accomplish a common goal is the most<br>important attribute of every leader.</p>

                                <p>My first major addition to a system was when I was in elementary school and<br>revolutionized a recycling program to significantly reduce waste in the<br>Belmont-Redwood Shores school district. Since then I have brought innovation<br>to many places including sports training facilities, little league umpiring organizations,<br>marketing companies, private investment groups, and my own business.</p>

                                <p>My father is an expert in client prospecting and spent years teaching me ways to<br>find and approach new clients. Prospecting is nearly an art form that I have grown<br>to appreciate and respect. Great prospecting saves a business valuable time and brings<br>the best clients to the table.</p>

                                <p>I grew up playing baseball in California from the age of 3 up until I graduated high<br>school. I quit playing baseball to focus on business and academics. However, I am<br>still passionate about the game and play as much as I can. My favorite baseball team<br>is the San Francisco Giants.</p>

                                <p>I have played guitar for over 8 years and am a huge fan of rock, jazz, and the blues.<br>My favorite guitar that I currently own is a 12-string Martin electric-acoustic guitar.<br>I was in a band during high school and made a christmas album. Music is a fantastic<br>way to spend any extra time.</p>

                                <p>My grandfather taught me how to use a fishing pole in a swimming pool before he took<br>me out to catch my first fish on the lake. I still remember my first day fishing and I have<br>enjoyed it ever since. Everytime out fishing is a new learning experience.</p>

                                <p>The first time I paddled in a kayak was on Pine Island in Florida. I remember seeing<br>dolphins and manatees right next to us and really enjoyed the experience. Nowadays<br>I go kayaking in the indian river lagoon and other small bodies of water in Florida.</p>
